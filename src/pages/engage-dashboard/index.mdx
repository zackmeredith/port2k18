# Engage — <br/>Dashboard app

---

**TLDR:** I worked as part of a collaborative, two person product design team to redesign our pilot app as we rebuilt it as an enterprise SAAS app. Dev time was short so we had to find small wins — which meant being efficient and deliberate with our improvements. I contributed by owning certain features, contributing to others, conducting user interviews/usability studies, and collaborating with engineers or PMs to refine and launch the app to customers.

Full case study coming soon.
