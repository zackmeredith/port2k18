# Pivotus Design System

---

**TLDR:** My first project at Pivotus was working across design and engineering to create our design system. This involved creating a component library as Sketch libraries — managed by Abstract, front-end architecture work for the accompanying system in code, creating universal components with React/React Native, creating tooling for developers with customers in mind, ensuring accessibility, and creating lots of documentation.
